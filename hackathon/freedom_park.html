<h2><p align="left">Freedom Park in Bengaluru is located in the heart of the city near Gandhi Nagara, less than 2 kms from Majestic and Cubbon Park. This Park showcases the campus that was formerly a central jail.</p>
   <p align="left"><i><u>History:</i></u> This central jail holds historical importance as it housed several prominent political leaders during the 1975 Emergency. Freedom Park was inaugurated by the former Union Minister Lal Krishna Advani and was made accessible to the public in 2008.</p>
   <p align="left"><i><u>Why to visit Park:</i></u> Freedom Park lets visitors gain a glimpse of life in prison. Elements of a prison such as residential quarters (known as barracks), watch tower, hanging spot and jail hospital can be seen. A jogger’s track & children’s play area are also available. Freedom Park is one of the few places where you can get a close view of correctional facilities.
