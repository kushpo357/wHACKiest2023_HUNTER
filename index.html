<h3>

Bengaluru (or Bangalore) is one of India’s most thriving metropolitan cities.<b> Its vibrant local culture and flourishing IT
 industry draw tourists, students, and professionals from across the country and the world</b>. Bangalore has many titles,
 known both as the ‘Silicon Valley of India,’ and as the ‘Garden City,’ the city has much to offer. While it may be known
 for its pubs and its many restaurants, there are many major tourist hotspots in and within a few km from Bangalore.
 Cubbon Park, Bangalore Palace, Lalbagh, MG Road, State protected monuments and Bull Temple are all well-known 
 attractions.

Many other places near Bangalore like Nandi Hills and Horseley Hills are a short drive away for day or weekend trips.
 However, there are plenty of other lesser-known and unique places to visit in Bangalore well worth exploring.
